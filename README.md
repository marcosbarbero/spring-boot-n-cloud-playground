>There's no place like https://start.spring.io/

This project is just a placeholder for all my Spring Boot/Cloud's tryouts.  

Each folder contains specific implementations and customizations per topic, later on each of these
will be detailed and published in my personal blog at http://blog.marcosbarbero.com.

If you found a bug or have any question don't hesitate to [file an issue](https://github.com/marcosbarbero/spring-boot-n-cloud-playground/issues).
